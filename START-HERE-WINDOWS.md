# RideSafe complete project — Windows Docker setup

This ZIP is the complete source, not a patch. Start with a fresh extracted folder to avoid mixed versions. Docker Desktop must be running in Linux containers mode. Host Node/npm installation is optional: the commands below use Docker.

## 1. Preserve your existing configuration and database

Your old project is D:\ridesafe. From Windows CMD:

```bat
cd /d D:\ridesafe
docker compose --env-file .env.production down
```

Do not add `-v`; keep existing database volumes. Do not delete the old folder yet.

Extract the new ZIP to D:\RideSafe-Full. The project root should be D:\RideSafe-Full\RideSafe (it contains package.json, Dockerfile and src).

```bat
cd /d D:\RideSafe-Full\RideSafe
copy D:\ridesafe\.env.production .env.production
```

Copying your existing configuration keeps the password required by the existing PostgreSQL volume. The commands below use `-p ridesafe` to keep the Compose project/volume names from your original D:\ridesafe installation. If you originally used a different Compose project name, use that name instead. Do not generate replacement database passwords for an existing database.

## 2. First install ONLY: generate configuration if no existing configuration/database

Skip this section if you copied your working .env.production above.

```bat
docker run --rm -v "%cd%:/app" -w /app node:20-slim node scripts/setup-docker.mjs
```

This writes .env.production with random database/JWT/tracking secrets, local service URLs and a Web Push key pair. It never overwrites an existing file and never prints secrets. APP_URL is http://localhost:3500 for this computer. Configure a real sender contact in VAPID_SUBJECT before enabling production push.

## 3. Verify the complete extraction

```bat
docker run --rm -v "%cd%:/app" -w /app node:20-slim node scripts/verify-source.mjs --strict
```

This must pass. It checks every delivered file and its hash, including the missing modules from your log. For your own later source edits use the default check without --strict; the normal build checks required file presence/casing rather than rejecting intentional edits.

## 4. Build and start

```bat
docker compose -p ridesafe --env-file .env.production config --quiet
docker compose -p ridesafe --env-file .env.production up --build -d
docker compose -p ridesafe --env-file .env.production ps
```

The first build may take several minutes while packages download and Next.js compiles. Deprecation warnings do not themselves mean the build failed. `npm ci` uses the supplied package-lock.json; do not replace it with a lockfile from an older project.

PostgreSQL and Redis start first. The app then applies included migrations and starts. Wait for ridesafe-app to become healthy.

If a service fails:

```bat
docker compose -p ridesafe --env-file .env.production logs --tail=100 ridesafe postgres redis
```

Open **http://localhost:3500**. The container uses port 3000 internally; the browser uses 3500.

## 5. First Super Admin (new database only)

Existing database: sign in with your existing account. There is no hardcoded default login.

For a new database, create a temporary file named .env.bootstrap in the project root using Notepad:

```dotenv
BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL="your-real-email@example.com"
BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD="choose-your-own-unique-password-at-least-8-characters"
BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_NAME="Super Admin"
```

Replace these example values, save, then run:

```bat
docker run --rm --network ridesafe_default --env-file .env.production --env-file .env.bootstrap ridesafe-local:latest node scripts/bootstrap-admin.mjs
```

After success delete the temporary credential file:

```bat
del .env.bootstrap
```

The bootstrap refuses to overwrite an existing Super Admin. It does not clear any database tables. Sign in and create the school, School Admin, driver/maintainer, bus, route/stops, parents and students in that order.

## 6. Live tracking, notifications and hardware worker

Mobile GPS requires permission and an active driver trip. For automatic hardware polling, configure the GPS provider credentials and TRACKING_WORKER_SECRET in .env.production, then:

```bat
docker compose -p ridesafe --env-file .env.production --profile tracking up --build -d
```

The optional worker calls the app through its internal Docker address. APP_URL must stay the browser-visible address.

Localhost is suitable for testing on this computer. To use GPS/push on other phones, serve the site over HTTPS and set APP_URL accordingly; a plain http://LAN-IP URL is insufficient for those browser features. Push keys must be present before building. Real provider/GPS/device testing is still required. The Parent page auto-arms the three-horn alert after its first tap/click; locked/background phones cannot be guaranteed custom horn playback and instead use the Web Push notification sound plus three-pulse vibration where supported.

Before Start Trip, assign the crew account to an ACTIVE bus, assign that bus an active route and driver, and assign at least one active student to the same bus/route with parent, pickup stop and drop-off stop. The Driver sidebar now lists whichever of these setup items is missing. Admin/Transport Coordinator can add and edit these students only inside its assigned school.

The Parent **Payments** page opens **Pay invoice** only when your invoice/payment provider returns a safe HTTPS checkout URL. Until the Malaysian payment provider is connected, invoices show **Payment setup pending** and are not falsely marked as paid.

## 7. Normal restarts

```bat
docker compose -p ridesafe --env-file .env.production stop
docker compose -p ridesafe --env-file .env.production start
```

Use `up --build -d` again after source/build-time setting changes. Avoid `down -v` because it deletes database volumes.

## Vercel

Use this complete folder as the repository/project root. Framework Next.js, install `npm ci`, build `npm run build`, default output directory. Upload every source file, including SOURCE-MANIFEST.json and scripts/verify-source.mjs. Keep package.json and package-lock.json together.

Set DATABASE_URL to your hosted PostgreSQL connection, REDIS_URL to a reachable Redis TCP/TLS connection, JWT_SECRET to a random 32+ character secret, APP_URL to your HTTPS site URL. Docker-only hosts postgres/redis are not reachable from Vercel. Configure optional provider keys and the public VAPID key before building. Run `npm run db:migrate` once with the production database connection from a trusted terminal. Redeploy without old build cache once after replacing an incomplete checkout.

Vercel does not execute this Docker Compose stack or a persistent background worker. Host the tracking worker separately if using automatic hardware polling.
